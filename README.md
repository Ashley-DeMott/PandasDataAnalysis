# Pandas Data Analysis

## Overview
Learning how to analyze data using Pandas and Python. Video game sales data set from kaggle.com shows the sales for video games that have surpassed 100,000 units sold. Also learning how to use CSV (comma-sepparated values) files.

## Data Analysis Results
Questions:
* What year has the most video game sales (above 100,000)?
* What is the highest selling game for each platform?

Results:
*
*

## Development Environment
Pandas (version) and Python (version)

## Useful Websites
* [Kaggle Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-video-game-sales)
* [Pandas - Filtering Data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/03_subset_data.html)

## Future Work
* Show graphs using MatPlotLib
* Allow user to choose what data is shown, similar language to SQL

## Additional Ideas
* Implement CRUD (Create Read Update Delete)
* User can specify a file (more general program)
* Work with other filetypes (determine function to use based on file ending)
* Additional questions/user determines questions
